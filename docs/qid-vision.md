# DigiByte Q-ID — Vision (Draft)

Status: **draft – TODO**

## 1. Intent

Q-ID is the **quantum-secure successor to Digi-ID**, providing
passwordless authentication and decentralized identity for the DigiByte
ecosystem.

It keeps the spirit of Digi-ID (simple, user-friendly login) while
upgrading the cryptography and design to stay safe in a future with
quantum-capable attackers.

## 2. Goals (TODO)

- Simple for everyday users.
- Easy to integrate for services and developers.
- Resistant to both classical and quantum attacks.
- Open, MIT-licensed, and community-driven.
- Designed to integrate with future DigiByte security tooling.

## 3. Non-goals (TODO)

- Q-ID will **not** change DigiByte consensus rules.
- Q-ID will **not** force KYC or real-world identity.
- Q-ID will **not** depend on centralized servers by design.

## 4. Next Steps (TODO)

- Describe user flows: registration, login, recovery.
- Describe how Q-ID works with Adamantine and Guardian.
- Add diagrams and examples once the core spec is stable.
