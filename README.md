# 🔐 DigiByte Q-ID  
## **Quantum-Ready Authentication Protocol with Hybrid Signatures, PQC Backends & Adamantine Integration**  
### **Developer Preview v0.1 — Designed for Long-Term Survivability**

> **Q-ID operates fully standalone, but can also integrate with the Adamantine Wallet and the DigiByte Quantum Shield to provide enhanced authentication telemetry, identity-level protection, and future PQC-ready wallet workflows.**

---

Q-ID is a **next-generation authentication protocol** engineered as the evolutionary successor to Digi-ID.  
It is not a simple upgrade — it is a **complete redesign** around:

- **Cryptographically signed authentication flows**  
- **PQC-ready signature backends (ML-DSA, Falcon)**  
- **Hybrid (dual-mode) signature support**  
- **Strict service binding & replay protection**  
- **Modular architecture** for any wallet or service  
- **Adamantine-native integration**  
- **Guardian / Shield telemetry compatibility**  
- **QR-first, passwordless login**  
- **Full test coverage & CI validation**

This README is intentionally deep and technical — a full architectural brief for any core engineer reviewing the protocol.

Q-ID is built to withstand not only today’s threats…  
but also **the next cryptographic era.**

---

# ⭐️ 1. Why Q-ID Exists  

Legacy Digi-ID is elegant — but limited:

- ❌ No signature on login responses  
- ❌ No PQC migration path  
- ❌ No hybrid crypto  
- ❌ No server-side verification standard  
- ❌ No strict service binding  
- ❌ No tamper detection  
- ❌ No nonce replay protection rules  

Q-ID fixes this by introducing a **fully signed, verifiable authentication model** with a flexible cryptographic backend designed for a world where **quantum computers become real adversaries**.

Q-ID integrates cleanly with Adamantine and the DigiByte Quantum Shield roadmap.

# ⭐️ 2. High-Level Architecture

```

Q-ID is composed of four coherent layers:

```
qid/
  crypto/           ← pluggable signature engines (Dev, PQC, Hybrid)
  protocol/         ← core login/registration flows
  integration/      ← Adamantine signing/verification helpers
  examples/         ← full demos (server, roundtrip, mobile)
```

---

# ⭐️ 3. Cryptographic Layer (PQC-Ready)

Q-ID ships with a **pluggable crypto backend system**.  
Every keypair, signature, and verification step goes through a backend chosen by algorithm identifier:

| Algorithm Name           | Purpose | Status |
|-------------------------|---------|---------|
| `dev-hmac-sha256`       | Development / CI / tests | ✔ Stable |
| `pqc-ml-dsa`            | PQC placeholder backend | ✔ Implemented |
| `pqc-falcon`            | PQC placeholder backend | ✔ Implemented |
| `hybrid-dev-ml-dsa`     | Dual-mode hybrid backend | ✔ Implemented |

### ✔ Backends are drop-in replaceable  
Real Falcon / ML-DSA implementations can replace the stubs without changing the API.

### ✔ Hybrid backend  
Simulates a “two-phase” signature:

```text
sig = SHA256_MAC(secret_part1) + SHA512_MAC(secret_part2)
```

### ✔ Canonical JSON signing  
All signatures operate on canonical, whitespace-free JSON bytes:

```python
json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))
```

This ensures deterministic multi-platform compatibility.

---

# ⭐️ 4. Protocol Layer (Q-ID Core)

The Q-ID protocol currently supports:

### ✔ Login Requests (QR → Wallet)
- service ID  
- nonce  
- callback URL  
- versioning  
- algorithm awareness  

### ✔ Login Responses (Wallet → Service)
- signed payload  
- strict validation of  
  `service_id`, `callback_url`, `nonce`, `address`, `key_id`, `algorithm`

### ✔ Registration Payloads  
For future expanded identity workflows.

Everything is strictly typed, canonicalized, and covered by tests.

# ⭐️ 5. Adamantine Wallet Integration (Full Support)

Q-ID has **first-class integration** with Adamantine:

```text
qid.integration.adamantine
```

Provides:

- wallet-side helpers to build signed responses  
- server-side helpers to verify them  
- strict validation of service identity & callback URL  
- PQC/hybrid keypair support  
- compatibility with Guardian / QWG / Shield telemetry  

In effect:

**Adamantine can become the first fully quantum-ready authentication wallet in DigiByte history.**

---

# ⭐️ 6. Server-Side Verification

Services verify login responses via:

```python
ok = verify_signed_login_response_server(
    service=SERVICE_CONFIG,
    login_uri=issued_login_uri,
    response_payload=payload,
    signature=signature,
    keypair=SERVER_VERIFICATION_KEYS,
)
```

Strict rules enforced:

- nonce must match  
- service_id must match  
- callback_url must match  
- signature must verify  
- algorithm must not be downgraded  

If any field changes → **authentication fails**.

Docs: `docs/qid-example-server.md`

# ⭐️ 7. Mobile Integration (iOS / Android)

Located in:

```text
examples/mobile/qr_scanner_demo.md
```

Includes:

- Swift QR scanner pseudocode  
- Kotlin QR scanner pseudocode  
- Base64URL decoding  
- JSON canonicalization rules  
- signature preparation  
- network POST examples  

This demonstrates exactly how real wallets should integrate Q-ID.

---

# ⭐️ 8. Complete Example Server

Run a working Q-ID service backend:

```bash
python examples/example_server.py
```

Endpoints:

```text
GET  /login  → generate qid:// URI
POST /verify → validate signed response
```

Self-contained, readable, and acts as a demo and reference.

---

# ⭐️ 9. Test Suite (Full Coverage)

Using `pytest` and GitHub Actions:

- crypto backend roundtrips  
- tamper detection  
- protocol parse/generate tests  
- Adamantine integration tests  
- PQC algorithm interface validation  
- hybrid signature verification  

All tests pass → CI is fully green.

---

# ⭐️ 10. Threat Model (v0.2)

Full professional threat model located in:

```text
docs/qid-threat-model.md
```

Covers:

- tampering  
- replay attacks  
- phishing  
- quantum adversaries  
- service impersonation  
- device compromise  
- downgrade attacks  
- cross-service confusion  
- Guardian/Shield integration points  

Exactly the level of detail required for serious protocol adoption.

---

# ⭐️ 11. Migration Path & Future Work

Q-ID is intentionally designed for:

### ✔ Seamless PQC migration  
Algorithm identifiers exist today, full implementations can replace stubs without breaking protocol compatibility.

### ✔ Hybrid transition  
Allows services to require dual-signature mode for higher assurance.

### ✔ Wallet ecosystem expansion  
Android/iOS reference scanning logic is included.

### ✔ Guardian / Shield synergy  
Q-ID events are perfect telemetry inputs for:

- Sentinel  
- DQSN  
- ADN  
- QWG  
- Adaptive Core  

Enabling multi-layer anomaly detection for authentication.

---

# ⭐️ 12. Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but Q-ID is a **security-critical protocol** and must remain:

- deterministic  
- fully tested  
- protocol-clean  
- PQC-ready  
- wallet-agnostic (while integrating cleanly with Adamantine and the Shield)

Please read **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** before opening a PR.  
Any change that weakens security, breaks determinism, or mixes wallet logic into the protocol layer will be rejected.
